From Curiosity to Impact: Yashwardhan Sharma’s Journey in AI Awareness and Entrepreneurship
</h1>

<div class="article-meta">
By The Rising Hindustan • February 2026
</div>

<div class="article-content">

<p>
Yashwardhan Sharma’s journey is rooted in a belief that meaningful impact is not defined by age, authority, or position, but by intent, consistency, and action. From a young age, he has approached technology not as a passing trend, but as a powerful tool capable of driving real-world change when understood and applied responsibly.
</p>

<p>
At the core of his story lies a simple yet powerful idea: progress begins when curiosity is paired with action. Instead of viewing technology as distant or inaccessible, Yashwardhan has consistently sought to understand how it works and how it can empower people at the grassroots level.
</p>

<h2>Early Curiosity and Interest in Technology</h2>

<p>
From an early stage, Yashwardhan was drawn to understanding how systems function, particularly in the digital and technological space. His interest gradually evolved into focused engagement with artificial intelligence and emerging tools.
</p>

<p>
For him, technology represented opportunity — the opportunity to simplify processes, bridge gaps, and create access where it previously did not exist. This perspective laid the foundation for his later work in AI awareness and entrepreneurship.
</p>

<p>
As his understanding deepened, one observation became clear: while technology was advancing rapidly, awareness at the grassroots level was not keeping pace.
</p>

<h2>Identifying the Awareness Gap</h2>

<p>
Yashwardhan recognized that the challenge was not the absence of technology, but the absence of understanding. Artificial intelligence was often seen as complex or intimidating rather than something that could be learned, questioned, and applied responsibly.
</p>

<p>
Instead of treating this as a passive observation, he chose to address it directly—by starting conversations and encouraging informed thinking among young learners.
</p>

<h2>The AI Awareness Initiative</h2>

<p>
With a clear objective, Yashwardhan organized an AI awareness event aimed at introducing students to artificial intelligence in a simple, relatable manner. The focus was real-world relevance rather than technical jargon.
</p>

<p>
More than 70 students participated actively, engaging through questions and discussion. The response highlighted a genuine hunger for understanding technology beyond surface-level usage.
</p>

<h2>Recognition and Media Coverage</h2>

<p>
The initiative received coverage across newspapers, news channels, and digital platforms. While the recognition brought visibility, it also reinforced responsibility rather than final achievement.
</p>

<h2>Entrepreneurship and the Birth of LootLynk</h2>

<p>
Alongside awareness work, Yashwardhan founded LootLynk, a startup focused on building practical digital products for local businesses. The aim is to make technology accessible, usable, and relevant for small enterprises.
</p>

<p>
Entrepreneurship became a learning ground—shaping lessons in resilience, execution, and adaptability.
</p>

<h2>Vision for Youth and Society</h2>

<p>
Looking ahead, Yashwardhan envisions working at the intersection of AI, education, and entrepreneurship. His goal is to empower youth not just as consumers of technology, but as informed and responsible creators.
</p>

<blockquote>
“Technology should empower, not intimidate. Initiative should not wait for permission.”
</blockquote>

<p>
This journey continues to evolve, guided by curiosity, responsibility, and the belief that consistent action—no matter how small—can lead to meaningful change.
