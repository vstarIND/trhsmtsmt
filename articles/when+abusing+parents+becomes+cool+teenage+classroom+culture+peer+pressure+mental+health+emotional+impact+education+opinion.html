When Abusing Parents Becomes “Cool”: A Classroom Reality No One Talks About
</h1>

<div class="article-meta">
By The Rising Hindustan • February 2026
</div>

<div class="article-content">

<p>
There is a silent culture spreading through teenage classrooms — one that rarely appears in official reports, parent-teacher meetings, or school magazines.
Yet students see it every day.
</p>

<p>
It is the normalization of abusing someone’s parents in the name of humor.
</p>

<p>
A mother’s name shouted across the room.
A father’s name twisted into an insult.
Laughter follows.
Claps follow.
Approval follows.
</p>

<p>
And just like that, humiliation becomes entertainment.
</p>

<h2>How It Begins</h2>

<p>
It rarely starts with hatred.
It starts with imitation.
One influential student says something bold.
Others laugh.
The attention feels powerful.
</p>

<p>
Soon, more students copy the pattern.
Because in teenage peer culture:
Shock value equals popularity.
Volume equals dominance.
Disrespect equals fearlessness.
</p>

<p>
The one who insults the loudest is often seen as the strongest.
And the one who reacts emotionally becomes the weakest.
</p>

<h2>The Victim’s Reality</h2>

<p>
But what about the student whose parents’ names are being used?
</p>

<p>
He forces a smile.
He laughs with them to avoid isolation.
He pretends it doesn’t matter.
</p>

<p>
But inside, something shifts.
</p>

<p>
Parents represent security, sacrifice, and identity.
When their names are used casually as abuse, it doesn’t just hurt pride.
It attacks belonging.
</p>

<p>
The damage is subtle at first:
Confidence drops slightly.
Participation reduces slightly.
Trust in classmates weakens slightly.
</p>

<p>
But repetition turns slight damage into silent erosion.
</p>

<h2>The Psychology of Superiority</h2>

<p>
Why do some students rely on parental insults to feel superior?
</p>

<p>
Often, it is not strength — it is insecurity.
When academic pressure is high and comparison is constant, some students search for alternative ways to dominate socially.
</p>

<p>
Insulting someone’s parents becomes a shortcut.
A performance of power.
A way to control the emotional space of the room.
</p>

<p>
The louder the humiliation, the higher the social reward.
</p>

<p>
And when bystanders laugh instead of objecting, the culture becomes normalized.
</p>

<h2>The Emotional Consequences No One Records</h2>

<p>
Schools measure marks.
They record attendance.
They track discipline.
</p>

<p>
But they do not measure humiliation.
</p>

<p>
They do not record how many times a student went home replaying insults in his mind.
They do not record how many times someone sat quietly instead of answering a question because their confidence was shaken.
</p>

<p>
Some students begin isolating themselves.
Some develop bottled anger.
Some lose focus academically.
</p>

<p>
And in extreme cases — when repeated humiliation combines with academic pressure, comparison, and fear of retaliation — vulnerable students may begin having dangerous thoughts.
Not because they are weak.
But because they feel trapped.
</p>

<h2>When Silence Becomes Complicity</h2>

<p>
The most dangerous part of this culture is not the insult itself.
It is the silence around it.
</p>

<p>
When classmates laugh.
When no one intervenes.
When teachers overlook “just joking.”
</p>

<p>
That silence sends a message:
This behavior is acceptable.
</p>

<p>
And once disrespect becomes acceptable, empathy begins to disappear.
</p>

<h2>A Classroom Should Build Character</h2>

<p>
Education is not only about grades.
It is about values.
</p>

<p>
A classroom should be a place where confidence grows — not where dignity is tested daily.
</p>

<p>
Real superiority is not humiliating someone’s parents.
Real strength is self-control. </p>
